Calculating a moderate budget for a trip to South Korea, including accommodation, meals, transportation, and activities, can vary depending on personal preferences, travel style, and the level of comfort desired. However, I can provide a rough estimate based on average costs.

### Accommodation:
- Moderate hotels or guesthouses: AUD 80 - 150 per night
- Total for 3 nights (Seoul): AUD 240 - 450
- Total for 1 night (Busan): AUD 80 - 150
- **Total Accommodation Cost**: AUD 320 - 600

### Meals:
- Breakfast: AUD 10 - 20 per person
- Lunch: AUD 15 - 30 per person
- Dinner: AUD 20 - 40 per person
- **Total Daily Meal Cost for 2**: AUD 90 - 180
- **Total Meal Cost for 4 days**: AUD 360 - 720

### Transportation:
- KTX train from Seoul to Busan (round trip): AUD 150 - 300 per person
- Metro and bus fares within Seoul and Busan: AUD 5 - 15 per day per person
- Taxi fares: AUD 20 - 50 per day
- **Total Transportation Cost for 2**: AUD 310 - 700

### Activities:
- Entrance fees for attractions: AUD 10 - 30 per person per attraction
- **Total Activity Cost for 4 days**: AUD 160 - 480

### Total Estimated Budget:
- **Accommodation**: AUD 320 - 600

This estimate provides a moderate budget range for two persons for a four-day trip to Seoul and Busan, covering accommodation, meals, transportation, and activities. Actual costs may vary based on individual preferences, exchange rates, and the availability of discounts or special offers. It's always a good idea to research prices, book accommodation and transportation in advance, and allocate some extra funds for unexpected expenses.
