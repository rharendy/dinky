### Suggestions for Using Ridesharing in Seoul

1. **Plan for Peak Times**: Ridesharing can be more expensive and harder to get during peak times (morning and evening rush hours). Plan your rides accordingly to avoid higher prices and longer wait times.
2. **Use Wi-Fi**: Ensure you have access to mobile data or Wi-Fi to use the apps. Many places in Seoul, including cafes and public areas, offer free Wi-Fi.
3. **Be Aware of Local Traffic**: Seoul's traffic can be heavy, especially during peak hours. Allow extra time for travel when using ridesharing services.
4. **Have Your Destination Ready**: Input your destination accurately to avoid miscommunication. Most drivers use GPS, but it's helpful to have the address written in Korean if possible.
5. **Safety First**: Confirm the car's license plate and driver details match those in the app before getting in. Share your trip details with a friend or family member for added safety.
6. **Language Barrier**: While many drivers understand basic English, having your destination written in Korean can help. Use translation apps if needed.
7. **Tipping**: Tipping is not customary in South Korea, so there's no need to tip your driver.
